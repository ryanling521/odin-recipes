    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is an amazing dish that can be created in under an hour. After heavily seasoning 
            the salmon with the ingredients below, you want to place the salmon in a searing pan
            with olive oil. Cook the salmon one on side until the side of the salmon is cooked 
            halfway. Then flip it.
        </p>
        <p>While the salmon is cooking, you should prepare your asparagus to save time. When the
            salmon is done, set it aside and cook the asparagus in the residule salmon oil.
            Season with oyster sauce and in a couple minutes it is done.
